Notes on SQL and SQLPlus
========================


## Check users blocking objects

select a.machine, a.process, a.blocking_session, a.sid, a.serial#, OBJECT_NAME, c.owner
from v$session a, v$locked_object b, dba_objects c
where b.object_id = c.object_id
and a.sid = b.session_id;


## Suppose you have a table purchase(id, day, price). Write an SQL query that
selects ids of the unique ones, such that no other purchases happened on
the same day by the same price.**

select id from purchase where (day, price) in (select day, price from purchase group by day, price having count(*) = 1);
