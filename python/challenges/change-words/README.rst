Design an algorithm that, given a word "start", calculates a sequence
of words from "start" to a word "end" in which two consecutive words
differ in only one letter.

For example, given the start word "shirt" and the end word "store",
the next sequence would be valid:
["shirt", "short", "shore", "store"] (given that all these words exist
in the dictionary)

Assume we have a source (file, variable or whatever) with a list of
existing words in English.
