Assumptions taken for simplicty:
- A maze is always going to be well defined in a rectangular shape (ie. nothing
  like "0\n00#\nG").
- The existing tests have been rewritten so that they follow the general
  guideline "test one thing", which in practical terms translate into
  "assert only one thing".
- Some extra tests have been added to show that I would also test the
  underlying code used by the two functions tackled in this problem.

Furthermore, the algorithm used is very simple and not as efficient as others.
Re-writing the solve() method so that it uses the A* algorithm would be an
interesting improvement.
