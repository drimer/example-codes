In order to follow the steps in the challenege, all that needs to be done is
run the following commands:
    $ python create_db.py  # to generate DB.sqlite, populated with comments
    $ python add_tables_and_rebalance.py  # to add columns and rebalance data

Notes on the implementation:
    - For the sake of simplicity, a few things (ie. number of tables, and
      path to the SQLite file used) have been hardcoded in the code instead
      of using configuration files or something similar.
    - The number of random comments inserted in the database can be easily
      changed in create_db.py, in the line that says:
          NUM_RANDOM_COMMENTS = 20

In order to check the status of the database at any point:
    $ sqlite3 DB.sqlite
    $ .tables
    $ .schema
    $ select * from <table_name>;
